'CodeBook.md' provides a brief description of the datasets and also of the variables of both final_df and summ_df

The contents of final_df are exported as 'tidy_dataset.csv' file.       
The contents of summ_df are exported as 'summ_tidy_dataset.csv' file.

The entire process for data cleaning and preparation is done in a single R script called 'run_analysis.R'. The script has well-defined comments already. Simply source the script and you will get both final_df and summ_df. The script will also produce a text file of summ_df.

You can choose to comment out codes at lines 51 and 52 if you already have the packages installed.
